## Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Project 3

This project aims to classify students according to if they are going to fail the school year or not. The rationale being that if it is possible to know this before hand, the student could be helped and mentored correctly to prevent this to happen. First the data is extracted and cleaned. We separete it in training and test sets and test various supervised learning algorithms using the sklearn library and train them, documenting the time the algorithms take to do so. At the end the best model by time/performace is selected.
